Overview
=============================================
A NodeJS API client for [v2 of the MailChimp API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/2.0/). Please note that we generate this client/wrapper, so while we're happy to look at any pull requests, ultimately we can't technically accept them. We will, however comment on any additions or changes made due to them before closing them.


###Usage
This can be installed via our [npm package](https://npmjs.org/package/mailchimp-api) using:
```
$ npm install mailchimp-api
```

---

A basic example app to help kickstart you which - will also automatically install this package - is over in a public [github](https://github.com/mailchimp/mcapi2-node-examples) repo
